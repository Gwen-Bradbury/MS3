## Introduction

![Apple Devices Picture](./documentation/responsive.png)

This is my third milestone project; Designed to exhibit my capabilities and skills in JavaScript, Python and Flask, as a student of Code Institute. (https://codeinstitute.net/)
The goal was to showcase my skills to potential employers/recruiters, on a topic that I'm deeply interested in.
My project allows users to discover new walks within the UK's 15 National Parks, inspiring them to get outside and enjoy the beautiful UK countryside.
My app contains a landing page, complete with headline image and images of the UK's National Parks, followed by a list of all the walks in the DB with a search bar for easy navigation throught these lists.
There's a login and register page containing required form fields that give you access to the rest of the app, where users can add and delete walks that they've added. There's also a 'My Walks' page that lists all the 
walks that they've added.
The last link is a 'Log Out' button that logs users out of the app by removing thier session cookies.
The app is colourful and engaging, drawing the user in with bright, bold images and standout text, which I hope entices them
to get planning thier next walking route.

A link to my website can be found [here](https://ms3-walkapp.herokuapp.com/)

## UX

### Goals -

The purpose of the app is to provide a simple, straightforward format presenting information about some of the UK's best National Park walks.
My app is designed for people interested in walking in the UK, and I'm hopeful my app
will give them the motivation towards getting out into the countryside more often and visiting somewhere new.
The app is fully functional and interactive giving the user a positive experience as they move throught the pages.
I focused on a design that would be engaging and easy to navigate so users will continue to repeatedly visit and make use of the
features implimented within the app.

### Wireframes -

I have produced a mock up of all of my app's pages. You can view them [here](./WIREFRAMES.md)

### Design

#### Design Process -

1. _Strategy Plane_ - From the onset I knew that my primary aim was to encourage people who enjoy walking to explore different UK National Parks in a way that was engaging and simple, 
therefore stimulating them to get back outdoors and into the countryside. My main focus thoughout this project has been to excute this aim. I started the UX process by making a list of user stories, which allowed me to visualise what would be necessary to satisy them.

2. _Scope Plane_ - Having decided the main aim for the project, I began outlining the key features that I wanted my app to have.
To do so, I focused on the Python and Javascript I would need to implement, as I knew this would be crucial to the aim of making the app interactive. This led me to decide that I wanted to focus on two key features: a registration form and login page, and a page for users to add walks to a list, with the added option to delete walks they've added if needed.
The app would need C R U D functionality with the user having the ability to Create, Read, Update and Delete walks they've added to the app.

3. _Structure Plane_ - Once I had narrowed down the features I wanted to include, I formulated the structure of my design into 7 seperate pages: The landing or 'Home' page, 'Login', 'Register', 'My Walks', 'Add Walk' and 'Add Park'.
The 'Home' page is the first page you see when visiting the app. It lists the National Parks and Walks within them. It also has links to the 'Login' and 'Register' pages. Both the previously mentioned pages contain forms with fields requiring a username and password in order to gain access to the rest of the site. Upon registering or logging in you get taken to the 'My Walks' page. 
This page lists all the walks that that user has added into it. The navbar links also navigate the user back to the 'Home' page, the 'Add A Walk' and, for the admin, the 'Add A Park' pages.
Both the 'Add A Walk' page allow users to add Walks, to the database using a simple form. The admin also has access to the 'Manage Parks' page which allows them to Edt, Add and Delete parks. These added parks and walks are then listed on the 'Home' page with the walks also listed on the 'My Walks' page. 
The last link in the navbar allows users to exit or 'Log Out' of the app.
I made navigation through the website easy with a fixed navbar and search box located on the 'Home' page.

- _Database Structure_ - I needed the data to be structured with the walks inside the parks. The walks would need the park name but would also need the username of the users. I used a data schema to help visualise how the database would be structured.

![Data Schema picture](./documentation/data_schema.png)

4. _Skeleton Plane_ - As mentioned in the Structure Plane, I decided to use a fixed navbar and search bar as the main source of navigation through the app. This allows the user to move thoughout the app at a pace that suits them, in the easiest way possible. Returning users can find the page they're looking for, using the navbar, without having to scroll through lots of information they've already seen on previous visits, 
and can use the search bar to search for the walks and parks that they're most interested in. The 'My Walks' page link in the navbar will also allow the user to locate all the parks and walks they've added to it, without scrolling through the database on the 'Home' page.

5. _Surface Plane_ - 

- For my design to work, I knew that it would be important to create a theme that would keep the user interested. My first design decision was therefore to make the app as bright and colourful with images from the three National Parks I'm focusing on, to gain and keep thier attention.
- With this in mind, I began experimenting with my wireframes. I found it useful to generate a color scheme using coolors, which provided me with contrasting colours for my website and found images that complemented that colour scheme. I used figma to make mock ups of my websites pages.
- With the wireframes complete I began experimenting with the libraries and technologies I would use for the features within my app. I used a different workspace for the different technologies needed for each feature.

> Note: Throughout the design process, I kept referring back to my original 'Main Aims' and 'User Stories' to make sure that my project was developing as intended.

#### Colour Pallette -

I used coolors to generate my colour scheme-

https://coolors.co/8e9aaf-cbc0d3-f0d1d4-dee2ff

And matched this as best I could to the CCS colors on Materialize, which I used throughout my project.

I used #37474f (Materialize shade: blue-grey darken-3) for the background color of my pages as it's dark and contrasts with my images.
I used #fff (white) as my text color as it stood out clearly against the dark background.
#eceff1 (Materialize shade: blue-grey lighten-5) as a background color to the flash messages, with #37474f (Materialize shade: blue-grey darken-3)
as the flash message text color.
#fff (white) is also used as the background to my burger menu on mobile devices with the #37474f (Materialize shade: blue-grey darken-3) text color
to give it some separation from the main page.
All Cancel and Delete buttons have a text color of #eceff1 (Materialize shade: blue-grey lighten-5) with a background colour of #37474F (Materialize shade: blue-grey darken-3).
All Edit and Add buttons have a text colour of #37474f (Materialize shade: blue-grey darken-3) and a background colour of #69F0AE (Materialize shade: green accent-2).
The back to top button has a background colour of #37474f (Materialize shade: blue-grey darken-3) and a background colour of #ECEFF1 (Materialize shade: blue-grey lighten-5).
with a hover element that changes the background colour to #CFD8DC (Materialize shade: blue-grey lighten-4).

All my colors were chosen for thier relaxing and calming shades, in keeping with the tone of the app. The National Parks are nature at it's most beautiful and being within them and finding peace within them, allows you the time
to relax and rejuvenate, with the added benefit of exercising by walking. 

#### Font -

I used a line height of 3 on my flash messages to make them stand out more and grab the users attention.

- _Cancel button_ - This button cancels the request to add a new walk.

Unfortunately I didn't have time to implement the 'Add to My Walks' button that would have been visiable on the 'Home' page. I've added it to the 'Features left to Implement' README.md section.

### Features left to Implement -

- _Dropdown Arrows in Accordion_ - Make them point up when the accordion is open.

- _Error Messages_ - Implement flask 404 and 500 error messages that are more user friendly for defensive design.

- _Add Dropdown_ - Add a dropdown for the miles/km in add/edit walks instead of having to type it.

- _Modal_ - Put the 'Add Park' form inside a modal.

- _Wildcard_ - Add wildcard to search bar.

- _Pagination_ - Use flask pagination for the parks and walks to avoid endless scrolling.

- _Active Class_ - Use flask to highlight current page on nav link.

- _Confirm Password_ - Another form box on the registration page that confirms the users password.

- _Add to My Walks button_- A button that allows users to add other users walks that they would like to do, to thier 'My Walks' page. The 'Delete' button will only delete the walk from thier page, not the DB. It won't have an 'Edit' button.

- _Contact Us Form_- A form that allows users to email the Admin if they have any problems when using the app. They will get an automatically generated email reply confirming the email has been received.

- _Language button_- A button that can be clicked that translates the site into different languages so more people can use it.

### Bugs and Fixes Implemented after Testing -

- _Walks_ - After Editing/Deleting/Adding a walk users now get taken to the 'My Walks' page instead of the 'Home' page. Using the cancel buttons within the Delete modal and Edit walk form will also take the user back to the 'My Walks' page.

- _.title Class_ - Give the users first name a capital letter.

- _Edit buttons_ - Renamed the 'Edit' buttons within the edit walk and park pages to 'Update'.

- _Images_ - Changed headline image as the origional one looked pixelated and streched.

- _Max-height_ - Added 'max-height: 240px;' on the park cards content section as on larger screen sizes there was a lot of white space.
